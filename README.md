# CodewarsChallenges

This repository consists of my solutions to many coding challenges that i solved daily in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) 

# Tech stack

Tech used: Vanilla JavaScript

# Optimizations

After some time i go back to past problems and challenges and try to solve them using different methods, refactor code and make it more readable

# What I've learned:

Codewars has helped me significantly with revision and repetition while also learning about new methods and tricks in JavaScript. 
In addition to sharpening my coding skills, it also helped me with managing my frustrations and how to approach a problem that i will not always have a clear answer to immediately
